<h1>Risk Assessment Module</h1>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on human life and the
global economy. To combat the pandemic’s spread, it is crucial to assess
the risk associated with it. A new R Shiny app has been developed to
assist in pandemic risk assessment. This report will discuss the app’s
features and how it can help in pandemic risk assessment.</p>

<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Based on the SORMAS dataset, risk was defined on the epidemiologcal
indicators for each Country/Region/Districts and was computed and
classified in three categories as:</p>
<ul>
<li>LOW</li>
<li>MODERATE</li>
<li>HIGH</li>
</ul>
<p>These risk levels and indicators are presented as tables and graphics
in an interactive dashboard. Parameters can be set dynamically: disease
and indicator to display, type of risk to consider, number of reference
and observation weeks (see below), risk thresholds. At present this
webapp only address and shows the information for only one disease
i.e.<strong>Coronavirus</strong>. This can be further upgrade in the
near future as we get the new information about any other pathogenic
diseases.</p>

<div id="features" class="section level2">
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The app has several features that assist in risk assessment. These
features include main page with four tabs, a sidebar panel, and group by
options.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Main page</p></li>
<li><p>Sidebar Panel</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Main Page</strong>: Main Page: The app’s main page
contains four tabs: Heatmap, Timeseries Analysis, Data, and
Information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Heat map</strong>: The Heatmap tab displays a map of the
selected region, highlighting areas with the highest number of COVID-19
cases, hospitalizations, or deaths and each column demonstrate the
observation week. Three different color form represents the risk type
(Red:High, Yellow: Medium, Green: Low).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time series</strong>: The Timeseries Analysis tab
displays a graph of the selected region’s COVID-19 case count,
hospitalization count, or death count over time.</p></li>
<li><p>Data: The tab “Data” shows the data computed in the back end as a
table. They are updated when the thresholds or the number of weeks are
changed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Info</strong>: The Information tab provides information
on how to use the app and how it works.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sidebar Panel</strong>: Sidebar panel consist of various
filters and parameters that allows user to select and visualize the risk
based on the given/selected information.</p></li>
<li><p>Location filter: This filter comprises three categories: By
Default as “Select All”</p></li>
<li><p>Country</p></li>
<li><p>Region</p></li>
<li><p>District</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here user can select country of interest, region and district and
then user need to click on apply button to start the process.</p>
<div id="indicator-types" class="section level3">
<h3>Indicator Types</h3>
<ul>
<li>Weekly case count</li>
<li>Weekly death count</li>
<li>Weekly hospitalization count</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="risk-types" class="section level3">
<h3>Risk Types</h3>
<p>This application allows user to select two risk types as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Absolute</p></li>
<li><p>Anomly</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absoulute Risk Type</strong>: In the absolute risk type,
there are three risk levels: low, moderate, and high. These risk levels
are determined based on whether the indicator value is below, between,
or above predefined thresholds. The thresholds are divided into two
categories: low-mid and mid-high. If the indicator value is below the
low-mid threshold, the risk is considered low. If the indicator value is
at or above the low-mid threshold but below the mid-high threshold, the
risk is considered moderate. If the indicator value is above the
mid-high threshold, the risk is considered high. It is important to note
that the thresholds used for each indicator type may differ based on the
specific situation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anomly Risk Type</strong>: In the anomaly risk type, a
statistical model is used to compare the current week’s indicator value
to previous weeks’ values to identify anomalies. The statistical model
used is a negative-binomial distribution. The model is trained on the
indicator values from the reference weeks, which are the weeks preceding
the observation weeks. The number of reference weeks is set by the user.
Once the model is trained, the indicator value from the observation week
is compared to the inferred negative-binomial statistical distribution.
The resulting probability is used to determine the risk level. The
anomaly thresholds are the probabilities below which the risk levels are
considered. The absolute thresholds on the counts are derived from those
probabilities, and the risk levels are then computed as in the absolute
risk case.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explanation of Anomly Risk Type</strong> Anomaly
detection is a process of identifying rare events or observations that
differ significantly from the expected or typical behavior. In the
anomaly risk type, statistical models are used to identify such events
or observations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s say we have a dataset of weekly sales figures for a retail
store. We want to detect any in the sales figures to identify potential
issues that need attention. We use a negative-binomial distribution
statistical model to identify anomalies.</p>
<p>To use the model, we first need to train it on the reference weeks,
which are the weeks preceding the observation week. The number of
reference weeks is set by the user. For example, if the user sets the
number of reference weeks to 4, then the model will be trained on the
sales figures from the four weeks preceding the current week.</p>
<p>Once the model is trained, we can use it to compare the sales figure
from the observation week to the inferred negative-binomial statistical
distribution. The resulting probability is used to determine the risk
level. The lower the probability, the higher the risk level. anomalies
The anomaly thresholds are the probabilities below which the risk levels
are considered. For example, if we set the anomaly threshold to 0.05,
then any observation with a probability less than 0.05 will be
considered an anomaly.</p>
<p>To compute the risk levels, we derive absolute thresholds on the
counts from the probabilities. For example, if the probability is 0.05,
we can derive an absolute threshold on the sales count, below which the
risk level will be considered high. In summary, the negative-binomial
distribution statistical model is used to detect anomalies in the sales
figures. The model is trained on the sales figures from the reference
weeks, and the resulting probability is used to determine the risk
level. The anomaly thresholds are the probabilities below which the risk
levels are considered, and the absolute thresholds on the counts are
derived from those probabilities.</p>

<div id="group-by" class="section level3">
<h3>Group By:</h3>
<p>The app also includes a Group By option, which allows users to view
data by country, region, district, or city. This feature helps users to
analyze the risk at different levels.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> In group by filter User must select at least 2
country/region/District to use group function.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the R Shiny app for pandemic risk assessment is a
powerful tool for assessing the risk associated with the pandemic. The
app’s features, including four tabs, a sidebar panel, and group by
options, make it easy for users to analyze the data and make informed
decisions. The system described in this report provides two types of
risk assessments: absolute and anomaly. The absolute risk type uses
predefined thresholds to determine risk levels, while the anomaly risk
type uses a statistical model to identify anomalies and calculate risk
levels based on the resulting probability. The thresholds and anomaly
thresholds used may differ based on the specific situation. The system
provides a useful tool for assessing and managing risk related to the
three indicators: weekly case count, weekly death count, and weekly
hospitalization count.With the ongoing pandemic, the app’s relevance is
critical, and it is a valuable tool for public health officials,
researchers, and policymakers.</p>
